# gaggiuino
Gaggiuino started as an idea to improve an already cappable coffee machine while keeping the machine looks and buttons functionality as close as possible to the original, an important part is that no internal cables/connectors were modified, all the connections were made by creating splitters using the purchased spade connectors.

First and foremost please do not underestimate the danger of electricity or overestimate your ability to work around it, only start working on your machine while it's  completely disconnected from the mains power socket, also by agreeing to follow the bellow guide i cannot be deemed responsible for any of the damage you induce to your house appliances, yourself, your cat, friend or gold fish and it will beyour entirely your fault! 

I will assume you have bought the necessary components and installed the related software.
